# carla-custom-police-officer

This project contains a police officer mesh, skeleton and animations. This project is related to build a foundation for further gesture detection algorithms. 

To install simply import the files into your existing carla build and place the NPC in the world. Further you can also add path points which the officer will then patrol.
